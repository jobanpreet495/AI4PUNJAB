# AI4PUNJAB
This is website which is developed to do works related to punjabi language such as transliteration, typepad, OCR, etc
We are still working over this site to add more functionalities especially related to punjabi language. At present website include:

* Transliterator: We have developed a transliterator for Punjabi to English (eg: ਪੰਜਾਬੀ --> Panjabi) and English to Punjabi (eg: Panjabi --> ਪੰਜਾਬੀ). Neural network approach(bi-lsmt) is used for developing this system

* Phonetic Dictionary : We have made rule based system for punjabi text to phoneme as well as IPA (International Phonetic Alphabets) which are used to develop TTs (Text to speech).
Moreover, we have also working to develop text to speech for punjabi language using deep learning approach.
